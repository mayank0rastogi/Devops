What does ls -lrt command do?

The ls command is used for listing the contents of a directory. The lrt part is a combination of three different options:

l: This is for the long listing of the contents. It shows one file in each line with additional info such as permissions, ownership, size, timestamps etc.
t: This one sorts the long listing output based on time.
r: This one reverses the order of ls command output.
So when you combine them all, you display the contents in the present directory sorted in reverse chronological order. The newest files are shown at the bottom.

The order of the options doesn't matter here. You'll get the same result for ls -lrt and ls -ltr.
